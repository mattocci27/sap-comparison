## Visualization

Non-log scale compares if the difference between flow rate by pressure and flow rate under tension (flow rate by pressure - flow rate under tension) is different from zero, whereas log scale compares the ratio between the two (log[flow rate by pressure / flow rate under tension]) is different from log one (log(1) = 0).

## Analysis

Posterior medians, 50%, and 95% credible intervals for standard deviations estiamted from the difference between pressure and tension indcued flows.

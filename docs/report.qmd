## Results

There was a significant shift in elevation between pressure and tension induced flow rates
(
`r fig("sma")`a,
SMA intercept:
`r sma_int[1]`
[95% CI:
`r sma_int[2]`
,
`r sma_int[3]`
]
).
The SMA slope was different from 1
(
`r fig("sma")`a,
SMA slope:
`r sma_slope[1]`
[95% CI:
`r sma_slope[2]`
,
`r sma_slope[3]`
]
).
These results suggest that pressure induced flow rates tend to be greater than tension induced flow rates for samples of lower flow rates (`r fig("sma")`a).

Pressure-level (i.e., 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 MPa) explained very little variation in the differences between pressure- and tension-induced flow rates (`r str_split(anova_yml$pressure, " ")[[1]][1]` of the total variance, Figs. `r fig_num("sma")`b, `r s_fig_num("coef_int_sd")`-`r s_fig_num("coef_int_diff")`), whereas species difference explained much more variation (`r str_split(anova_yml$species, " ")[[1]][1]` of the total variance, Figs. `r fig_num("sma")`b, `r s_fig_num("coef_int_sd")`-`r s_fig_num("coef_int_diff")`).
An interaction between species and pressure-level effects was not selected after model selections.
After controlling species and pressure-level effects (i.e., hierarchical model), pressure induced flow rates still likely to be greater than tension induced flow rates (`r s_fig("coef_int_mean")`).

Posterior medians (circles), 50% (rectangles), and 95% (thin lines) credible intervals (CIs) for species and pressure effects on the ratio between pressure and tension induced flows.
Positive values indicate pressure induced flow rates are greater than tension induced flow rates.
Pressure induced flow rates tend to be greater than tension induced flow rates (positive ks_ratio parameter).
This suggests a probability of getting larger values for pressure induced flow rates than for tension induced flow rates is about 90% (but less than 95%).
This is consistent with `r fig("sma")`ab.

The estimates for AP is smaller than HH, TG, and VM, suggesting that the difference between pressure and tension induced flow rates tends to be smaller for AP compared to HH, TG, and VM given that the overall effects is positive,

There is large variation but pressure-level (i.e., 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 MPa) explained very little variation in the differences between pressure- and tension-induced flow rates of the total variance in (A).
Positive values indicate pressure induced flow rates are greater than tension induced flow rates in (B) and (C).
The positive ks_ratio parameter in (B) suggests that pressure induced flow rates tend to be greater than tension induced flow rates.

## Methods

**This is just a note for now.**

### Analysis (ANOVA-like hierarchical model)

We can make the hierarchical model like the previous model, but we can include measurement errors from the raw data too.
We don't want to waste the data!

$$
y^{meas}_{1ijk} \sim N(y_{1ijk}, \sigma_{y1ijk})
$$

$$
y^{meas}_{2ijk} \sim N(y_{2ijk}, \sigma_{y2ijk})
$$

$$
\alpha_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{\alpha})
$$
$$
\beta_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{\beta})
$$

$$
\mathrm{ln}\; y_{1ijk} \sim N(\mu + \alpha_j + \beta_k + \mathrm{ln}\; y_{2ijk}, \sigma)
$$

- *i*: Observation

- *j*: Species

- *k*: Pressure level

- $y^{meas}_{1ijk}$: Measured mean pressure induced flow rates for *i*th observation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (data).
$y^{meas}_{2ijk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $y_{1ijk}$: True pressure induced flow rates for *i*th observation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (parameter).
$y_{2ijk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $\sigma_{y1jk}$: Standard deviation of pressure induced flow rates for *i*th obervation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (data).
This data can be estimated from the raw data with multiple measurements.
$\sigma_{y2jk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $\mu$: Overall (species and pressure-level independent) effects.

- $\alpha_j$: Species effect

- $\beta_k$: Pressure-level effect

- $\sigma_{\alpha}$: Standard deviation of the species effect

- $\sigma_{\beta}$: Standard deviation of the pressure-level effect

- $\sigma$: Standard deviation of the model (i.e., residuals)


I will show several figures from this single analysis.

We can translate the posterior distribution of standard deviations into an ANOVA like statement.

For example, we can calculate the species effect like:

$$
\frac{\sigma^2_{\alpha}}{\sigma^2_{\alpha} + \sigma^2_{\beta} + \sigma^2} \times 100\;(\%)
$$

The effect of interactions was not selected after model selections.

note:

- median and 50% CIs

- Species: `r anova_yml$species`

- Pressure: `r anova_yml$pressure`

- Residuals: `r anova_yml$residuals`



# Pressure vs. number of active vessels

## Results

Overall, increasing pressure tended to linearly increase the proportion of vessels participating in flow (`r s_fig("coef_int_quad_mean")`).
Each species showed quadratic responses (Figs. `r fig_num("count_pressure")`-`r s_fig_num("coef_int_quad_mean")`).
The proportion of vessels participating in flow for *Hopea hongayensis* decreased at 0.08 MPa because XXXX.

## `r fig("count_pressure")`

Changes in proportion of silicon-stained vessels along perfusion pressures.
Lines and shaded areas indicate the posterior medians and 95% credible intervals, respectively.
Size of data points (in blue) is proportional to the total number of vessels.
The right columns are fluorography images of active vessels under UV light using silicon-perfusion. Red scale at right bottom represents 500$\micro$m.

## `r s_fig("coef_int_quad_mean")`

Posterior medians (circles), 50% (rectangle), and 95% (thin lines) credible intervals (CIs) for model coefficients of the effects of perfusion pressure on the probability of a vessel filled with silicon.

![coef_intervals_logistic](`r here::here("figs/coef_intervals_logistic.png")`){ width=450 }

## Methods

**tentative**

We modeled the probability of a vessel filled with silicon as linear and quadratic logistic functions of perfusion pressures with varying- intercepts and slopes by species (Supporting information X).
Model selection using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO; @Vehtari2014; @Vehtari2017) suggested that the quadratic model performed better (the difference in expected log pointwise predictive accuracies between the two models was 207.9), and thus we only report the result of the quadratic model.

# Coefficients *a* and *b* without traits

## Results

The power-law fittings without (i.e., traditional approaches) and with (i.e., multilevel approaches) inter-segment variation yielded similar estimates for coefficients *a* but slightly different estimates for coefficients *b* (Figs. S5-6; Table S4).
Generally, the estimates of coefficients *a* and *b* tended to increase with increasing maximum applied pressure gradients (Fig. S7-9).
Note that the larger the maximum applied pressure gradients, the larger the sample sizes for the analyses.
Our multilevel model revealed little variance in the estimates of coefficient *a* and *b* between species (Fig. 3 and Table S5).
Xylem types (80.77% of total variance) were the largest source for the variance for coefficient *a*, while segments (40.26% of total variance) were the largest source for the variance for coefficient *b* (Table S5).


## Pool vs multi

### `r fig("pool_multi")`

Relationships between sap flux density and sap flow index K ((△T~max~-△T)/△T) for diffuse-porous tree (red), ring-porous tree (purple), palm (blue) and liana (green) species.
The K values are the averages of two sets of sensors from each segment to account for sapwood variation along the segment.
The dashed and solid lines represent posterior medians of the power-law relationships without (i.e., traditional approaches) and with (i.e., multilevel approaches) inter-segment variation, respectively.

## Pressure gradients


### `r fig("pg_multi")`

Relationships between sap flux density and sap flow index K ((△T~max~-△T)/△T) for different upper limits of pressure gradients (Pg) for diffuse-porous tree (red), ring-porous tree (purple), palm (blue), and liana (green) species.
Different lines indicate different maximum pressure gradients for subsets of data used to draw posterior medians of the power-law relationships with inter-segment variation (i.e., multilevel approaches).

![pg_multi](`r here::here("figs/pg_multi.png")`)

### `r s_fig("pg_ribbon_a")`

Relationships between the coefficient *a* and the maximum applied pressure gradient (Pg) for diffuse-porous tree (red), ring-porous tree (purple), palm (blue), and liana (green) species.
Solid points indicate posterior medians of the power-law relationships with inter-segment variation (i.e., multilevel approaches).
Light and dark shaded areas indicate 95% and 50% Bayesian credible intervals, respectively.
The maximum applied Pg are different among species because segment length are different.
Species × maximum applied Pg combinations with less than 5 data points were removed from this visualization.
Therefore, the lower ranges for maximum applied Pg are also different among species.

![pg_ribbon_a](`r here::here("figs/pg_ribbon_a.png")`)

### `r s_fig("pg_ribbon_b")`

Relationships between the coefficient *b* and the maximum applied pressure gradient (Pg) for diffuse-porous tree (red), ring-porous tree (purple), palm (blue), and liana (green) species.
Details as for Fig. `r s_fig_num("pg_ribbon_a")`.

![pg_ribbon_b](`r here::here("figs/pg_ribbon_b.png")`)

### `r s_table("without_traits_table_0.02")`

Note: This table is too large and should be put in a separate file.
We have this table for each maximum applied Pg (0.02 - 0.08).

Bayesian estimates of posterior median, upper and lower credible intervals and effective sample sizes for multilevel model without traits when we limited the maximum applied pressure gradients below 0.02 MPa.
The column definitions are:

- variable_name: name of the variable in the stan model
- level: overall, xylem type, species, or segment
- targets: name of xylem type, species, or segment
- variable_meaning: meaning of the variable
- q50: posterior median
- q2.5: 2.5% posterior quantiles
- q97.5: 97.5% posterior quantiles
- effective_sample_size: tail effective sample size > 400 indicates good convergence [@Vehtari2021].

For example, variable `beta[2,1]` indicates the coefficient *a* for diffuse-porous trees.

# Coefficients *a* and *b* with traits

## Results

The 95% CI and 50% CI of the relationships between K~s~ and coefficient *a* and between K~s~ and coefficient *b* did not overlap with zero, respectively (Figs. 4B, D).

### `r s_table("all_seg_table")`

Note: This table is too large and should be put in a separate file.

Bayesian estimates of posterior median, upper and lower credible intervals and effective sample sizes for multilevel model with all traits.
The column definitions are:

- variable_name: name of the variable in the stan model
- level: overall, xylem type, species, or segment
- targets: name of xylem type, species, or segment
- variable_meaning: meaning of the variable
- q50: posterior median

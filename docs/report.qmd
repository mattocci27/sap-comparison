```

## Results

We found that pressure type (pressure vs. tension) has a marginal effect on the induced flow rate.
Although a strong relationship emerged within each species between tension- and pressure-derived *K~s~*, a significant shift was found in elevation between pressure- and tension-induced flow rates
(
`r fig("sma")`a,
SMA intercept:
`r sma_int[1]`
[95% CI:
`r sma_int[2]`
,

]
).
The SMA slope was different from 1
(
`r fig("sma")`a,
SMA slope:
`r sma_slope[1]`
[95% CI:
`r sma_slope[2]`
,
`r sma_slope[3]`
]
).
Pressure-induced flow rates tend to be greater than tension-induced flow rates for samples of low flow rates, converging with increasing flow rates (`r fig("sma")`a).

Pressure-level (i.e., 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 MPa) explained very little variation in the differences between pressure- and tension-induced flow rates,
whereas species difference explained much more variation
(`r str_split(anova_yml$pressure, " ")[[1]][1]` vs. `r str_split(anova_yml$species, " ")[[1]][1]` of the total variance,
Figs. `r fig_num("sma")`b &
`r s_fig_num("coef_intervals_pres_tens")`a;
`r s_table("anova_pres_tens")`).
After controlling species and pressure-level effects (i.e., hierarchical model), pressure induced-flow rates still likely to be greater than tension-induced flow rates (`r s_fig("coef_intervals_pres_tens")`b).

(A) Estimates for standard deviations.
(B) Estimates for the effect of each predictor.
(C) Estimates for differences in effects between predictors.
There is large variation but pressure-level (i.e., 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 MPa) explained very little variation in the differences between pressure- and tension-induced flow rates of the total variance in (A).
Positive values indicate pressure induced flow rates are greater than tension induced flow rates in (B) and (C).
The positive ks_ratio parameter in (B) suggests that pressure induced flow rates tend to be greater than tension induced flow rates.
The estimate for AP is smaller than HH, TG, and VM in (C), suggesting that the difference between pressure and tension induced flow rates tends to be smaller for AP compared to HH, TG, and VM.
HB shows the similar pattern with AP.

## Methods

**This is just a note for now.**

### Analysis (ANOVA-like hierarchical model)

We can make the hierarchical model like the previous model, but we can include measurement errors from the raw data too.
We don't want to waste the data!

$$
y^{meas}_{1ijk} \sim N(y_{1ijk}, \sigma_{y1ijk})
$$

$$
y^{meas}_{2ijk} \sim N(y_{2ijk}, \sigma_{y2ijk})
$$

$$
\alpha_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{\alpha})
$$
$$
\beta_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{\beta})
$$

$$
\mathrm{ln}\; y_{1ijk} \sim N(\mu + \alpha_j + \beta_k + \mathrm{ln}\; y_{2ijk}, \sigma)
$$

- *i*: Observation

- *j*: Species

- *k*: Pressure level

- $y^{meas}_{1ijk}$: Measured mean pressure induced flow rates for *i*th observation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (data).
$y^{meas}_{2ijk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $y_{1ijk}$: True pressure induced flow rates for *i*th observation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (parameter).
$y_{2ijk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $\sigma_{y1jk}$: Standard deviation of pressure induced flow rates for *i*th obervation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (data).
This data can be estimated from the raw data with multiple measurements.
$\sigma_{y2jk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $\mu$: Overall (species and pressure-level independent) effects.

- $\alpha_j$: Species effect

- $\beta_k$: Pressure-level effect

- $\sigma_{\alpha}$: Standard deviation of the species effect

- $\sigma_{\beta}$: Standard deviation of the pressure-level effect

- $\sigma$: Standard deviation of the model (i.e., residuals)


I will show several figures from this single analysis.

We can translate the posterior distribution of standard deviations into an ANOVA like statement.

For example, we can calculate the species effect like:

$$
\frac{\sigma^2_{\alpha}}{\sigma^2_{\alpha} + \sigma^2_{\beta} + \sigma^2} \times 100\;(\%)
$$

The effect of interactions was not selected after model selections.

- Pressure: `r anova_yml$pressure`

- Residuals: `r anova_yml$residuals`



# Pressure vs. number of active vessels

## Results

Overall, increasing pressure tended to linearly increase the proportion of vessels participating in flow (Figs. `r fig_num("count_pressure")` & `r s_fig_num("coef_int_quad_mean")`).
Although quadratic function best described the responses, the proportion of vessels participating in flow rate for *Hopea hongayensi* increased was highest in the intermediate pressure, but either remained the same or increased to a maximum moving from the intermediate to the highest pressure in the other four species (Figs. `r fig_num("count_pressure")` & `r s_fig_num("coef_int_quad_mean")`).


## `r fig("count_pressure")`

Changes in the proportion of silicon-stained vessels along perfusion pressures for diffuse-porous (A-C: red), ring-porous (D: green), and liana species (E: purple).
Lines and shaded areas indicate the posterior medians and 95% credible intervals, respectively.
The size of data points is proportional to the total number of vessels.
The right columns are fluorography images of active vessels under UV light using silicon-perfusion.
The red scale at the bottom right represents 500$\micro$m.

## `r s_fig("coef_int_quad_mean")`

![coef_intervals_logistic](`r here::here("figs/coef_intervals_logistic.png")`){ width=450 }

## Methods

**tentative**

We modeled the probability of a vessel filled with silicon as linear and quadratic logistic functions of perfusion pressures with varying- intercepts and slopes by species (Supporting information X).
Model selection using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO; @Vehtari2014; @Vehtari2017) suggested that the quadratic model performed better (the difference in expected log pointwise predictive accuracies between the two models was 207.9), and thus we only report the result of the quadratic model.

# Coefficients *a* and *b* without traits

## Results

The power-law fittings without (i.e., traditional approaches) and with (i.e., multilevel approaches) inter-segment variation yielded similar estimates for coefficients *a* but slightly different estimates for coefficients *b* (Figs. S5-6; Table S4).
Generally, the estimates of coefficients *a* and *b* tended to increase with increasing maximum applied pressure gradients (Fig. S7-9).
Note that the larger the maximum applied pressure gradients, the larger the sample sizes for the analyses.
Our multilevel model revealed little variance in the estimates of coefficient *a* and *b* between species (Fig. 3 and Table S5).
Xylem types (80.77% of total variance) were the largest source for the variance for coefficient *a*, while segments (40.26% of total variance) were the largest source for the variance for coefficient *b* (Table S5).

## Pressure gradients


### `r s_fig("pg_multi")`

Relationships between sap flux density and sap flow index K ((△T~max~-△T)/△T) for different upper limits of pressure gradients (*P~g~*) for diffuse-porous tree (red), ring-porous tree (purple), palm (blue), and liana (green) species.
Different lines indicate different maximum pressure gradients for subsets of data used to draw posterior medians of the power-law relationships with inter-segment variation (i.e., multilevel approaches).

![pg_multi](`r here::here("figs/pg_multi.png")`)

### `r s_fig("pg_ribbon_a")`

Relationships between the coefficient *a* and the maximum applied pressure gradient (*P~g~*) for diffuse-porous tree (red), ring-porous tree (purple), palm (blue), and liana (green) species.
Solid points indicate posterior medians of the power-law relationships with inter-segment variation (i.e., multilevel approaches).
Light and dark shaded areas indicate 95% and 50% Bayesian credible intervals, respectively.
The maximum applied *P~g~* are different among species because segment length are different.
Species × maximum applied *P~g~* combinations with less than 5 data points were removed from this visualization.
Therefore, the lower ranges for maximum applied *P~g~* are also different among species.

![pg_ribbon_a](`r here::here("figs/pg_ribbon_a.png")`)

### `r s_fig("pg_ribbon_b")`

Relationships between the coefficient *b* and the maximum applied pressure gradient (*P~g~*) for diffuse-porous tree (red), ring-porous tree (purple), palm (blue), and liana (green) species.

![pg_ribbon_b](`r here::here("figs/pg_ribbon_b.png")`)

### `r s_table("without_traits_table_0.02")`

Note: This table is too large and should be put in a separate file.
We have this table for each maximum applied *P~g~* (0.02 - 0.08).

# Scaling

## Uncertainty from a-b coefficients

Sup flux per 10 min is calculated as:
$$
S_{10min} = a \times K_s^b \times A_{sap} \times 600
$$

where $K_s$ is the esimated value from directions and depths when sencors are not avaiable and the oberved value when sensors are avaiable,
$A_{sap}$ is sapwood area esimated from DBH and sapwood length,
and 600 is the number of seconds in 10 min.

There 4 components contribute to the uncertainty in sap flux per 10 min:

- a, b
- ks (estimated from directions)
- ks (estimated from depths)
- sapwood length (estiamted from DBH)

For now, only the uncertainty from a-b coefficients are included in the final estimates.
Medians were used for other components.

The sap flux for each 10-minute interval was aggregated for each tree, resulting in a two-year total sap flux per tree.
To obtain an annual value, this two-year total was divided by 2.
The annual sap flux (Gg year^-1^ per tree) was then converted to Giga units by multiplying it by 10^-9.


Columns are:

- s_total_fd_m: total sap flow (median, 50% quantile)
- s_total_fd_ll: total sap flow (2.5% quantile)
- s_total_fd_l: total sap flow (25% quantile)
- s_total_fd_h: total sap flow (75% quantile)
- s_total_fd_hh: total sap flow (97.5% quantile)

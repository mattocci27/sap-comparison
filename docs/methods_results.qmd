## Methods



## Results

We found that pressure type (pressure vs. tension) had a marginal effect on the induced flow rate.
Although a strong relationship emerged within each species between tension- and pressure-derived *K~s~*, a significant shift was found in elevation between pressure- and tension-induced flow rates
(
`r fig("sma")`a,
SMA intercept:
`r sma_int[1]`
[95% CI:
`r sma_int[2]`,
`r sma_int[3]`
]
).
The SMA slope was different from 1
(
`r fig("sma")`a,
SMA slope:
`r sma_slope[1]`
[95% CI:
`r sma_slope[2]`,
`r sma_slope[3]`
]
).
Pressure-induced flow rates tend to be greater than tension-induced flow rates for samples of low flow rates, converging with increasing flow rates (`r fig("sma")`a).

Pressure-level (i.e., 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 MPa) explained little variation in the differences between pressure- and tension-induced flow rates,
whereas species difference explained much more variation
(`r str_split(anova_yml$pressure, " ")[[1]][1]` vs. `r str_split(anova_yml$species, " ")[[1]][1]` of the total variance,

`r s_fig_num("coef_intervals_pres_tens")`a;

After controlling species and pressure-level effects (i.e., hierarchical model), pressure-induced flow rates still likely to be greater than tension-induced flow rates (`r s_fig("coef_intervals_pres_tens")`b).

## Methods

**This is just a note for now.**

### Analysis (ANOVA-like hierarchical model)

We can make the hierarchical model like the previous model, but we can include measurement errors from the raw data too.
We don't want to waste the data!

$$
y^{meas}_{1ijk} \sim N(y_{1ijk}, \sigma_{y1ijk})
$$

$$
y^{meas}_{2ijk} \sim N(y_{2ijk}, \sigma_{y2ijk})
$$

$$
\alpha_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{\alpha})
$$
$$
\beta_j \sim N(0, \sigma_{\beta})
$$

$$
\mathrm{ln}\; y_{1ijk} \sim N(\mu + \alpha_j + \beta_k + \mathrm{ln}\; y_{2ijk}, \sigma)
$$

- *i*: Observation

- *j*: Species

- *k*: Pressure level

- $y^{meas}_{1ijk}$: Measured mean pressure induced flow rates for *i*th observation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (data).
$y^{meas}_{2ijk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $y_{1ijk}$: True pressure induced flow rates for *i*th observation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (parameter).
$y_{2ijk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $\sigma_{y1jk}$: Standard deviation of pressure induced flow rates for *i*th obervation from *j*th species, under *k*th pressure level (data).
This data can be estimated from the raw data with multiple measurements.
$\sigma_{y2jk}$ is for tension calibration.

- $\mu$: Overall (species and pressure-level independent) effects.

- $\alpha_j$: Species effect

- $\beta_k$: Pressure-level effect

- $\sigma_{\alpha}$: Standard deviation of the species effect

- $\sigma_{\beta}$: Standard deviation of the pressure-level effect

- $\sigma$: Standard deviation of the model (i.e., residuals)


I will show several figures from this single analysis.

We can translate the posterior distribution of standard deviations into an ANOVA like statement.

For example, we can calculate the species effect like:

$$
\frac{\sigma^2_{\alpha}}{\sigma^2_{\alpha} + \sigma^2_{\beta} + \sigma^2} \times 100\;(\%)
$$

The effect of interactions was not selected after model selections.

- Pressure: `r anova_yml$pressure`

- Residuals: `r anova_yml$residuals`

# Pressure vs. number of active vessels

## Methods

We modeled the probability of a vessel filled with silicon as linear and quadratic logistic functions of perfusion pressures with varying- intercepts and slopes by species (Supporting information X).
Model selection using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO; @Vehtari2014; @Vehtari2017) suggested that the quadratic model performed better (the difference in expected log pointwise predictive accuracies between the two models was 207.9), and thus we only report the result of the quadratic model.

## Results

Overall, increasing pressure tended to linearly increase the proportion of vessels participating in flow (Figs. `r fig_num("count_pressure")` & `r s_fig_num("coef_int_quad_mean")`).
Although quadratic function best described the responses, the proportion of vessels participating in flow rate for *Hopea hongayensi* increased was highest in the intermediate pressure, but either remained the same or increased to a maximum moving from the intermediate to the highest pressure in the other four species (Figs. `r fig_num("count_pressure")` & `r s_fig_num("coef_int_quad_mean")`).

![`r fig("count_pressure")`

# Coefficients *a* and *b*

## Methods

Using a power-law function as the foundational model form, we applied two different Bayesian model approaches to analyze the relationship between *F*~d~ and K.
Our first approach treated segments as the unit of analysis, considering inter-segment, interspecific, and xylem-type variations.
We call this approach the "multilevel approach."
On the other hand, our second approach followed a more conventional route.
Here, we treated species as the unit of analysis, and inter-segment variation was not considered.
We have labeled this method as the "pooled approach."
Considering the dependency of K ranges on the maximum applied pressure gradients (*P~g~*), we used nine distinct datasets based on different ranges of *P~g~* in our analysis
(Maximum *P~g~*  [MPa m^-1^]:
0.02,
0.025,
0.03,
0.035,
0.04,
0.05,
0.06,
0.07, and
0.08).

Additionally, we built Bayesian hierarchical models that incorporated wood traits ($\rho$, VAF, VF, and D~h~) and hydraulic trait K~s~.
These traits were included as species-level predictors for coefficients *a* and *b*, and were integrated into our "multilevel approach."

## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- read_csv(here("data/varpart_notrait.csv"))
a_xylem <- d |>
  filter(Levels == "Xylem types") |>
  pull(a) |>
  str_extract("[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+") |>

b_seg <- d |>
  filter(Levels == "Segments") |>
  pull(b) |>
  str_extract("[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+") |>
  as.numeric()
```

There are:

- Pool vs multi
- Pressure gradients
- Variance partitioning
- Model with traits

The power-law fittings without (i.e., traditional approaches) and with (i.e., multilevel approaches) inter-segment variation yielded similar estimates for coefficients *a* but slightly different estimates for coefficients *b* (Figs. `r s_fig_num("pool_multi")`-`r s_fig_num("ab_points")`; Table `r s_table_num("ab_comparison")`).
Generally, the estimates of coefficients *a* and *b* tended to increase with increasing maximum applied pressure gradients (Figs. `r s_fig_num("pg_multi")`-`r s_fig_num("pg_ribbon_b")`).
Note that the larger the maximum applied pressure gradients, the larger the sample sizes for the analyses.
Our multilevel model revealed little variance in the estimates of coefficient *a* and *b* between species (`r fig("coef_density")` and Table `r s_table_num("varpart_notrait")`).
Xylem types (`r a_xylem`% of total variance) were the largest source for the variance for coefficient *a*.
In comparison, segments (`r b_seg`% of total variance) were the largest source for the variance for coefficient *b* (Table `r s_table_num("varpart_notrait")`).

The 95% CI and 50% CI of the relationships between K~s~ and coefficient *a* and between K~s~ and coefficient *b* did not overlap with zero, respectively (Figs. `r fig_num("traits_points_main")`B, D).
VAF did not show significant correlation either with coefficient *a* or coefficient *b* (Figs. `r fig_num("traits_points_main")`A, C).

Bayesian estimates of posterior median and 95% credible intervals of the coefficients *a* and *b* values for 31 species obtained based on traditional curve fitting (Granier, 1985) and our multilevel model.

# Scaling

## Method

First, we need a summary paragraph to describe what we wanted to do here:
- we want to scale measurements to annual stand transpiration
- we setup device to measure K values, we applied Fd-K model to estimate sap flux density
- There are a lot of missing K values, we used missForest to impute missing K values
- We explain how to scale K values to annual stand transpiration

We used the missForest algorithm [@Stekhoven2012] to handle missing K values in our dataset.
This algorithm uses an ensemble of decision trees, known as a Random Forest, to predict and fill in the missing values.
It treats the missing value as a response variable and the observed values as predictors, iteratively estimating the missing data points until convergence.
The missForest algorithm has been proven to perform robustly, providing reliable imputations with minimal assumptions about the underlying data distribution [@Stekhoven2012].
As predictors, we used all the observed values, including K, date, time, VPD, PAR, tree ID, direction, and depth.
Because our dataset is huge (> 4M rows), we applied missForest to each month separately.
The estimated out-of-bag (OOB) error rates were < xxx for all the months.

We have K values for three depths (0-2cm, 2-4cm, and 4-6cm) and four directions (north, south, east, and west), but not all the trees have all the combinations.
We used the K values measured at a 0-2 cm depth and from the southern direction as reference values, and estimated the effects of depth and direction on K using a Bayesian linear mixed model.
When there are observed K values for the focal depeth and direction, we used the observed values for the subsequent analysis.
When there are no observed K values for the focal depeth and direction, we used the predicted median K values from the linear mixed model for the subsequent analysis.
K values were completely missing for tree ID 16 in 2015. We assigned the mean K values from the other trees to this tree.

Over two years, we conducted 15 measurements of DBH.
We employed interpolation techniques to estimate the corresponding values for the days when DBH was not measured.
We then modeled sapwood length as a function of DBH using a Bayesian linear model.
We used the posterior median of the model and interpolated DBH to estimate daily sapwood length.

## Uncertainty from a-b coefficients

Sup flux per 10 min is calculated as:
$$
S_{10min} = a \times K^b \times A_{sap} \times 600
$$

where $K$ is the estimated value from directions and depths when sensors are not available and the observed value when sensors are available,
$A_{sap}$ is sapwood area estimated from DBH and sapwood length,
and 600 is the number of seconds in 10 min.

These are 4 components that contribute to the uncertainty in sap flux per 10 min:

- a, b
- K (estimated from directions)
- K (estimated from depths)
- sapwood length (estimated from DBH)

Only the uncertainty from a-b coefficients is included in the final estimates.
Medians were used for other components.
To obtain an annual value, this two-year total was divided by 2.
The annual sap flux (Mg year^-1^ per tree) was then converted to Mega units by multiplying it by 10^-6.

Values are the annual sap flux for each tree and for each applied Pg (Mg year^-1^ per tree).

Columns are:

 - pg: pressure gradients
 - x_pool: pooled (traditional) fitting
 - x_segments: segments (multilevel) fitting
 - x_ll: 2.5% quantile
 - x_l: 25% quantile
 - x_m: 50% quantile (median)
 - x_h: 75% quantile
 - x_hh: 97.5% quantile
 - s_total_granier: estimated by Fd = 119*K^1.23 (this values are assgined for pg = 0.02 for a codijng purpose)

The figure below shows the sum of all trees divided by 800 m^2^.
Thick bars indicate medians, and error bars indicate 95% quantiles based on the uncertainty of a-b coefficients.
The estimates from Granier's equation look more reasonable and estimates from our model are higher than that.
Granier's b is 1.23, which makes Fd values very small for K < 1 (e.g., 0.01 ^ 1.23 is much smaller than 0.01), but our estimate for b is about 1.
Given that K < 1 in our data, the b value (b = 1) is one of the reasons why our estimates are very high.
